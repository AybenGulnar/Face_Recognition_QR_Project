# Face_Recognition_QR_Project
The main purpose of the staff attendance module is to work with schools, companies, etc. It is to provide a quick and easy solution in places where there are many entrances and exits or where attendance needs to be controlled. To achieve this goal, the tools it uses are face detection and recognition as well as QR code analysis.


Face detection and recognition are designed for employees. QR code analysis, on the other hand, is designed for people who do not need to have their entries and exits recorded, such as visitors or company managers.

Interfaces
There are 2 interfaces within the scope of the project and it works similar to the first interface management system. The second interface is the main interface where the person identification and participation control are made.

1. It contains the functions of adding and deleting personnel in the interface. Personnel are added to the database and system by using the employee's photo entry together with the employee's name-surname information obtained through the interface.

When any row is selected in the employee list on the interface and the deletion is performed, the records of the employee are deleted from both the system and the database.


2. The interface consists of a screen showing the camera output. The faces and QR codes read on the screen are indicated here with the relevant output. The process of joining the database, which is made after the face recognition function, which is realized as a result of face scanning, takes place here.
